AI Engineer Assessment Task 
Role: AI Engineer 
Duration: 3 Days (72 hours) 
Submission: GitHub repository + README + Demo Video (5–7 minutes) 
1. Objective 
The goal of this task is to evaluate your ability to design and implement a production-grade, 
multi-agent AI system with real-time interaction, modular backend architecture, and a 
modern frontend. 
You will build an AI-powered Candidate Assessment Platform that: 
• 
Collects candidate data from multiple sources 
• 
Builds a unified knowledge base 
• 
Performs chat-based and voice-based AI interviews 
• 
Uses a multi-agent system with Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) handoff to HR 
This task is intentionally scoped to test system design, agentic workflows, backend 
engineering, real-time AI, and applied LLM usage—not just prompt engineering. 
2. High-Level System Overview 
The application consists of four major layers: 
A. Frontend (Next.js) 
• 
Candidate data input 
• 
Chat-based AI assessment UI 
• 
Real-time avatar-based voice interview UI 
• 
HR review dashboard 
B. Backend (FastAPI) 
• 
Modular API services 
• 
Background processing & caching 
• 
WebSocket-based real-time communication 
• 
Multi-agent orchestration

C. AI Layer 
• 
LangChain / LangGraph-based multi-agent system 
• 
LLM of your choice 
• 
Voice + avatar-based real-time agent 
D. External Providers (Your Choice) 
• 
LLM Provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, etc.) 
• 
Avatar Provider (D-ID, HeyGen, LiveKit Avatar, etc.) 
• 
Real-Time Communication (LiveKit preferred) 
3. Functional Requirements 
3.1 Candidate Data Ingestion 
The system must accept the following inputs: 
• 
LinkedIn Profile URL 
• 
GitHub Profile URL 
• 
Resume Upload (PDF) 
Backend Responsibilities: 
• 
Fetch and parse public LinkedIn & GitHub data (mocking allowed) 
• 
Extract experience, skills, projects, education, and GitHub activity 
• 
Parse resume PDF into structured JSON 
Constraints: 
• 
Use background tasks for ingestion 
• 
Implement caching (Redis or in-memory) 
3.2 Knowledge Base Construction 
• 
Combine all extracted data into a unified candidate knowledge base 
• 
Store data for RAG and agent reasoning 
• 
Optional: Vector database (FAISS, Chroma, Weaviate) 
3.3 Multi-Agent System (Core Requirement) 
Required Agents: 
• 
Profile Analyzer Agent 
• 
Technical Interviewer Agent 
• 
Behavioral Interviewer Agent 
• 
Evaluation Agent 
• 
HR Handoff Agent (Human-in-the-Loop)

Agents must communicate, remain modular, and demonstrate orchestration logic. 
3.4 Chat-Based AI Assessment 
• 
Web-based chat interface 
• 
WebSocket-based backend 
• 
Context-aware responses from knowledge base 
3.5 Real-Time Voice Interview with Avatar 
• 
One-to-one voice-based interview 
• 
Live audio streaming (LiveKit preferred) 
• 
STT → LLM → TTS pipeline 
• 
Avatar-driven interviewer 
3.6 Human-in-the-Loop (HR Review) 
• 
AI-generated final assessment report 
• 
HR dashboard with scores, strengths, risks, and recommendations 
• 
Optional manual HR override 
4. Technical Requirements 
Backend (Mandatory): 
• 
FastAPI 
•

• 
WebSockets 
• 
Error handling & logging 
Frontend (Mandatory): 
• 
Next.js 
• 
Modern UI (Tailwind / ShadCN) 
• 
Responsive design 
AI Stack:
